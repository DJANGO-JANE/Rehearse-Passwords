# Rehearse-Passwords
PassMApp is a console application that can help you memorise your passwords.
I am a bit skeptical about online apps that store passwords so I prefer to memorise them at all costs, and behold!
PassMApp was born. It is a personal project but I reckon others might want to try it too. It is still under construction but it is testable and usable. Passwords are encrypted. Sources for that could be provided as well.

UPGRADES NEEDED:
So far it needs some upgrades still.

-When rehearsing passwords, the password you enter appears as plain text on the screen and I would like to replace that with asterisks (*), in case your annoying brother is standing close to you :).

-Work to be done on the decryption method in my encryption dll (DjaneCryption). It is just a simple implementation of RSA encryption algorithm just to suit the needs of this light-weight app.

-An implementation of a function or algorithm to search through the .dat file for a random account name and send it to the Rehearse Password menu after each attempt. For now, it's just the same rehearsal of the last added record.

More will be added. Suggest any features I can improve on.
